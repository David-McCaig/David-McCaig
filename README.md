PartsBin is an online marketplace designed for mountain biking enthusiasts. Find new/used bikes and parts, enjoy a responsive UI, secure token-based authentication, and the ability to post ads. Photos are stored with Cloudinary, and a chat app using Socket.IO enables easy communication. State management is handled using React's Context API.

Brainflix is a fully responsive full-stack web application that mimics YouTube.  This was one of the first React apps that I created while attending the Brainstation Software Engineering bootcamp.  Some of the features include being able to select what video you would like to watch, commenting on each video and uploading a video. Initially the project was built using Express, Node and JSON data for the backend but I decided to go back and build a database using MySQL, Knex, express and node.

 ## Get Out (2nd Place In Hackathon)
 https://github.com/michaelshimeles/get-out

During a 24-hour Hackathon at the Brainstation Web Development Bootcamp, our team, composed of two UX designers, one Data Scientist, and two Web Developers, set out to revamp LoyaltyOne's Air Miles reward program for Millennials and Gen Z. Our solution? An engaging application that gamifies the experience using a star balance to track progress. We made earning and redeeming points a breeze with a user-friendly digital wallet earning us **2nd place in the competition**.

## InStock Warehousing & Inventory Management

Instock is a warehouse and inventory management system that was built in a week by a team of four developers using Agile work flows (Jira) and GitFlow. Every morning we would have a stand-up to mimic a work environment. I really enjoyed working with Jira, gitFLow and Scrum methodologies. It really allowed us to take a project that felt daunting at the time and break it down into more manageable bite sized pieces. Instock is a fully responsive full-stack web application.
