PartsBin is an online marketplace for buying and selling new and used Mountain bikes and Mountain bike parts. It is a fully responsive Full Stack app with a beautiful UI. The app uses Token based authentication and the ability for users to post ads. I've also created a chat app using Socket.IO so users can coommunicate with each other.

## InStock Warehousing & Inventory Management

Instock is a warehouse and inventory management system that was built in a week by a team of four developers using Agile work flows (Jira) and GitFlow. Every morning we would have a stand-up to mimic a work environment. I really enjoyed working with Jira, gitFLow and Scrum methodologies. It really allowed us to take a project that felt daunting at the time and break it down into more manageable bite sized pieces. Instock is a fully responsive full-stack web application.

 [Frontend](https://github.com/David-McCaig/david-mccaig-brainflix)|[Backend](https://github.com/David-McCaig/david-mccaig-brainflix-server)


Brainflix is a fully responsive full-stack web application that mimics YouTube.  This was one of the first React apps that I created while attending the Brainstation Software Engineering bootcamp.  Some of the features include being able to select what video you would like to watch, commenting on each video and uploading a video. Initially the project was built using Express and node for the backend but I decided to go back and build a database using MySQL ,Knex, express and node.
