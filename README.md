## InStock Warehousing & Inventory Management

Instock is a warehouse and inventory management system that was built in a week by a team of four developers using Agile work flows (Jira) and GitFlow. Every morning we would have a stand-up. With such a tight deadline it was really important to bring up any blockers you might be having to move the project forward. Instock is a fully responsive full-stack web application.

## BrainFlix
[Backend](https://github.com/David-McCaig/david-mccaig-brainflix-server) |
[Frontend](https://github.com/David-McCaig/david-mccaig-brainflix)

Brainflix is a fully responsive full-stack web application that mimics YouTube.  This was one of the first React apps that I created while attending the Brainstation Software Engineering bootcamp.  Some of the features include being able to select what video you would like to watch, commenting on each video and uploading a video. Initially the project was built using Express and node for the backend but I decided to go back and build a database using MySQL ,Knex, express and node.
