### Hi there 👋 I'm David.

✍️ 🪖 🚀 ⚡️  
**I'm a Software Engineer with a love for creating beautiful UI 🌄.**

💼 &nbsp;🔭 I’m currently working on [PartsBin](https://github.com/David-McCaig/parts-bin)   
🔭 &nbsp;I like to follow my nose – endlessly curious about systems, software, programming, the web, and CS.  
🎨 &nbsp;Fun fact: I used to be an ad agency art director, and have worked on national campaigns for brands like KFC and LG.  
🎹 &nbsp;When I'm not coding: I love making music with my collection of synthesizers, shooting photos and Mountain Biking.   
🙋‍♂️ &nbsp;he/him
